# Simple MDSVEX Site ( SMDS )

> Current status: builds are working how I want. Considering how to package a binary for this that takes the content folder as an argument and creates builds.

## TODO:

- build-time embeds
- syntax highlighting
- bun or deno binary distribution?

## DONE

- builds
- relative and static image packaging
